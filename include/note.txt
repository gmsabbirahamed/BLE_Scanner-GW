Your firmware will run long-term fine with 20 tags.

To scale to 100 tags:

Increase MAX_SENSORS.

Replace String with char[] to avoid memory fragmentation.

(Optional) Move sending to a FreeRTOS task for clean separation.

ESP32 + NimBLE can handle ~100 advertising devices, but keep setScanCallbacks(..., true) (duplicates reported) since you need the latest values.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to rewrite your firmware with the char[] fix + FreeRTOS sender task so itâ€™s ready for 100 tags, or just keep it simple with MAX_SENSORS = 100 and String?
